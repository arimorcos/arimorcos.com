Hello internet! Welcome to Fairly One-Dimensional, my blog about finding patterns in complex datasets. My goal is to post a new analysis of some freely available dataset every week or two (assuming my [research](http://www.arimorcos.com/research/) allows me the time). These posts will usually be motivated by questions about the data itself, but I'll probably also post analyses intentionally constructed to make use of various techniques in machine learning I want to try out. As I'm a huge baseball fan, I imagine a fair number of posts will focus on sabermetrics as well. In making this blog, I was inspired by a bunch of people doing awesome analyses, especially [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), [Randal Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/blog/),  [Baseball Prospectus](http://www.baseballprospectus.com), and [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com).

As for the website itself, it's built with a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) back end and [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the front end. I had never built a website before, and it's been a lot of fun learning about the amazing resources people have come up with. The [source](https://github.com/arimorcos/arimorcos.com) is available on Github.
