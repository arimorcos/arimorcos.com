                Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven themselves capable of learning to solve a wide range of challenging tasks. However, the solutions these networks use to solve these tasks remain poorly understood, earning DNNs their reputation as black boxes. Furthermore, our lack of understanding of DNN solutions means we also lack a clear understanding of their bottlenecks, making intelligent, scientifically motivated improvements extremely challenging.  As a result, our field has largely improved DNNs through trial and error, distributed across hundreds, if not thousands, of groups across the world. This situation is akin to trying to build a clock without understanding how individual gears fit together.

                Using rigorous, scientific methods (often inspired by neuroscience), my goal is to better understand the solutions used by DNNs and, perhaps most critically, their bottlenecks, so that we can build intelligent systems intelligently.
