                I am a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.com/" target="_blank">
                DeepMind</a> in London, working on using neuroscience-inspired approaches to understand and build better thinking systems.

                I recently completed my PhD in the lab of
                <a href="http://www.harveylab.org" target="_blank">Chris Harvey</a> at Harvard Medical School. For my thesis work, I worked on methods to understand how neuronal circuits perform the computations necessary for complex behavior. In particular, my research focused on how parietal cortex contributes to evidence accumulation  decision-making. I am also interested in using novel analysis techniques from machine learning to us to better understand neuronal circuits and vice-versa. I am especially excited by thinking how insights from real neuronal circuits can help us to improve artificial neural networks and to towards AGI.

                For my undergraduate work, I attended UCSD where I worked with <a href="http://logg.salk.edu/" target="_blank">Fred Gage</a> to investigate the role of REST/NRSF in adult neurogenesis.

                When I'm not working, I like to go on adventures throughout  London with my partner, Julia, and our awesome dog, Dash. I'm also a history buff and love reading random books about the two World Wars and the Cold War.
