                I am currently a graduate student in the lab of
                <a href="http://www.harveylab.org" target="_blank">Christopher Harvey</a> at Harvard Medical School. Prior to coming
                to Harvard, I attended UCSD where I worked with <a href="http://logg.salk.edu/" target="_blank">Fred Gage</a>
                on the role of REST in adult neurogenesis. I am fascinated by complexity in all things, which is why
                I'm studying the most complex machine I've been able to find: the mammalian brain.

                I am interested in understanding how neuronal circuits perform the computations necessary for complex
                behavior. In particular, my research focuses on how parietal cortex contributes to evidence accumulation
                for decision-making. I am also interested in using novel analysis techniques from machine learning to
                help us to better understand neuronal circuits and vice-versa. I am especially excited by thinking
                about how insights from real neuronal circuits can help us to improve artificial neural networks.

                I started this website/blog to pursue analysis of data sets that don't involve neurons. I'll choose
                data sets which seem interesting, random questions I'm curious about, and try to use this as an
                opportunity to try out a variety of data analysis techniques, especially those stemming from machine
                learning. Should I find something worth sharing, I'll make a blog post about it.

                When I'm not in the lab or coding, I like to go on adventures throughout Boston with my awesome dog,
                Dash. I'm a borderline obsessive baseball fan and know the names of way more prospects than is
                probably healthy. I'm also a history buff and love reading random books about the two World Wars and the
                Cold War.
